# Cardiac Contraction Analysis for Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code, notebooks, and automation pipelines developed as part of the MSc dissertation by **Nivedita Saha** (Keele University, 2023-24).

The project investigates how cardiomyocyte contraction patterns (from both **2D and 3D models**) can be analysed and used with **machine learning** to distinguish between normal and disease-affected cardiac cells.

## Features
- **Data preprocessing** from Myocyter & Musclemotion outputs
- **Exploratory data analysis & visualization** of contraction metrics
- **Machine learning models**: Random Forest, SVM, KNN
- **Automation workflows** using **Prefect**
- **2D vs 3D contraction analysis** for robustness
- **Model explainability** with SHAP & LIME
- **High accuracy (up to 96%)** for 3D disease vs normal classification
